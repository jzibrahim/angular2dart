Sample code for getting started with Angular2Dart

GameShow is my personal tutorial for Angular2Dart.  This is a trivia game.

- 0_component- Bootstrap the app with one component
- 1- Use text interpolation to show user's name.
- 2_template- Move the template to a separate file.
- 3_form- Use material components to allow user to enter name and level at which they want to play the game.
- 4- Make name required and use ngHidden.
- 5- Make a question card. Make a card component, show questions to user.  Let user pick answer, then tell them if itâ€™s right or wrong.
- 6_service- Use a service to get a random card from easy or hard sections.  After the user answers the question, wait three seconds, then show the next question.
- 7- Make the options a list and use *ngFor on them and add a progress bar
